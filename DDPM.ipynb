    "#### Reverse Process (Denoising)\n",

    "This part of the model helps explain why and how we can learn the reverse process. We want the reverse process to approximate the true posterior distribution of the data (i.e., the reverse distribution).

    "In the forward process, we transform data $\\mathbf{x}_0$ (e.g., an image) into a sequence of noisy versions $\\mathbf{x}_1, \\mathbf{x}_2, \\ldots, \\mathbf{x}_T$ through a gradual addition of Gaussian noise. By the end of the process (at time step $T$), the data should resemble pure noise, typically modeled as a Gaussian distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, I)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The forward process is defined as a Markov chain, where each state $\\mathbf{x}_t$ depends only on the previous state $\\mathbf{x}_{t-1}$. Specifically, we can express this step-wise transition as:\n",

    "At each step $t$, a small amount of Gaussian noise is added to the previous state $\\mathbf{x}_{t-1}$. This noise is parameterized by $\\beta_t$, which controls how much noise is injected at each step.
